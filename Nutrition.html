<h2>FITNESS PLAN:</h2>
<button class="collapsible"><b>What is Nutrition?</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p><b>Human nutrition</b> deals with the provision of essential nutrients in food that are necessary to support human life and good health.

In humans, poor nutrition can cause deficiency-related diseases such as blindness, anemia, scurvy, preterm birth, stillbirth and cretinism,or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome; and such common chronic systemic diseases as cardiovascular disease,diabetes, and osteoporosis.<b>Undernutrition</b> can lead to wasting in acute cases, and the stunting of marasmus in chronic cases of malnutrition.</p>

<h2>Foods To Add To Your Diet</h2>
<p class="para">There are three macronutrients that all play a crucial role in maintaining bodily functions and promoting changes in strength and composition – they are carbs, proteins, and fats. It is essential that we consume all three macros in ample quantities to optimize progress.</p><br>


<button class="collapsible"><b>Carbohydrates</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <img src="carbohydrates-1.jpg" alt="Carbohydrate" class="img">
  <p>Firstly, carbohydrates are the <b>primary source of energy</b> for the body and therefore play the most substantial role in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates – <i>complex and simple</i>. The names give an indication of the time taken to digest; complex carbs take a longer time period to digest than simple carbs.
Complex carbohydrates provide the body with prolonged slow-release of energy and have a great nutritional benefit. While simple carbohydrates provide the body with a short-term, fast releasing energy, they contain little nutritional value.
For this reason, you should look to primarily consume complex carbohydrates. Some foods to consider adding to your diet include <b>whole-grains, oats, beans, nuts, fruits, and vegetables.</b></p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible"><b>Protein</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <img src="protein-1-1.jpg" alt="Protein" class="img">
  <p>The majority of gym-goers will be well aware that consuming protein is important. The reason why protein is so important is that, it <b>plays a key role in recovery and repair</b>. During exercise, the body is exposed to strains and stresses which cause damage to occur to the muscles at a microscopic level. In order for the damage to be repaired, protein is needed. Without it, recovery periods will be extended and chronic fatigue may become a factor.
Protein is found most highly in animal produce such as lean meats, eggs & dairy. It can also be found in smaller quantities in foods such as seeds, nuts, legumes, beans, and soy.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible"><b>Fats</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <img src="fats-1.jpg" alt="Fats" class="img" >
  <p>Fats are often incorrectly seen as the primary reason for fat gain. However, fats are not responsible for this and actually play a key role in the <b>absorption and transport of nutrients.</b> In addition, they can have a positive impact on heart health and hormone production.
While fats can have a positive impact on health, there are several types of fat – some of which are of greater benefit than others. While saturated fats are not as harmful as once believed, focus primarily on unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel), oils (olive, peanut, sesame), and soy products (tofu, soy milk).</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible"><b>Pre-Workout Plan</B></button>
<div class="content">
  <img src=" pre-workout-foods-1.jpg" alt="Pre-Workout Food" class="img">
  <p>
    The focus with all pre-workout meals or snacks should be <b>carbohydrates to provide the body with plenty of energy</b> to last the full session. If energy levels are sub-optimal, then performance will suffer which will have a consequent impact on our rate of adaptation.
To prime the body for performance, focus on primarily consuming complex carbohydrates such as whole-grains, oats, beans, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Be aware not to consume them just before the workout as they take time to digest. The recommendation is to consume complex carbs one to <b>two hours prior to exercise</b> to allow for full digestion.
From that point, focus on simple carbohydrates as they take less time to digest and provide the body with bursts of energy. It may even be recommended to consume some simple carbs during a workout to maintain energy levels and performance.
White bread, jam, granola, cereal, rice cakes, sports drinks, and fruit are all viable options for a pre-workout, energy-boosting snack.
While the focus should predominantly be on carbohydrates, it is also important to consume some protein prior to stepping into the gym. To support muscle recovery and growth, protein levels should be maintained at a high level throughout each day.
  </p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible"><b>Post-Workout Food</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    The purpose of post-workout nutrition is two-fold – to <b>promote muscle recovery and replenish energy</b>. Therefore, the focus should once again be on consuming good quality protein and carb foods.
As reflected on, the stress of training cause micro tears to occur to the muscles that must be repaired. Consuming protein will cause a process known as muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to occur which will begin the repairing process and prevent muscle breakdown.
There is a widely held belief that protein timing is extremely important for maximizing growth, however, a number of studies have indicated that total daily protein intake is of greater importance than the timing.
High-protein foods such as lean beef, chicken, pork, turkey, eggs, dairy, seeds, quinoa, and nuts should be prioritized. Protein supplements, like protein shakes and bars, can serve as a convenient tool for effectively boosting protein intake.
Carbohydrates should also form part of post-workout nutrition as the energy that has been expended during exercise must be replaced.
    If possible, it is recommended to <b>consume protein and carbs together</b> as this will have the most pronounced impact on recovery by enhancing protein and glycogen (energy) synthesis. Often a ratio of 3:1 carb to protein is prescribed for optimizing recovery.

<h2>Foods To Avoid</h2>
<img src=" no-to-junk-food-1.jpg" alt="Avoid Food" class="avoid_food">
<p class="para">
  In the same way that proper nutrition has the potential to optimize performance and adaptation, improper nutrition can detrimentally affect progress and health. The following three foods should be avoided or limited as far as possible.<br>
Trans fats are a type of dietary fat that has consistently been shown to impact health. While trans fats do naturally occur in small quantities, artificial trans fats are notoriously hazardous. Artificial trans fats can be found in baked goods, fast food, and many snack foods.<br>
As mentioned, many simple carbohydrate foods do not have great nutritional value and contain a high amount of sugar. While they may be useful for a short term energy boost, consuming a large number of simple carbs can be detrimental.<br>
Eating a great quantity of simple carbohydrates will spike blood sugar levels initially. However, very quickly, blood sugar levels will nosedive and can leave you feeling lethargic which is less than optimal for exercise and performance.
Although technically not a food, alcohol is a substance that should also be limited as far as possible. There is much research to indicate that alcohol negatively impacts recovery and may even interfere with the muscle-building process.
