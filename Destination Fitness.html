    <b style="padding:25px; font-size:18px">Main workout area<br></b>
<p>Most health clubs have a main workout area, which primarily consists of free weights including dumbbells and barbells and the stands and benches used with these items and exercise machines, which use gears, cables and other mechanisms to guide the user's exercise. This area often includes mirrors so that exercisers can monitor and maintain correct posture during their workout. A <b style="color:blue">gym</b> that predominantly or exclusively consists of free weights (dumbbells and barbells), as opposed to exercise machines, is sometimes referred to as a <b>black-iron gym</b>, after the traditional color of weight plates.<br></p>
 <b style="padding:25px; font-size:18px">Cardio area/exercise theatre<br></b>
<p>A cardio theater or cardio area includes many types of cardiovascular training-related equipment such as rowing machines, stationary exercise bikes, elliptical trainers and treadmills. These areas often include a number of audio-visual displays, often TVs (either integrated into the equipment or placed on walls around the area itself) in order to keep exercisers entertained during long cardio workout sessions. Some gyms provide newspapers and magazines for users of the cardio theatre to read while working out.</p>
 <b style="padding:25px; font-size:18px">Group exercise classes<br></b>
<p>Most 2010-era health clubs offer group exercise classes that are conducted by certified fitness instructors or trainers. Group exercise classes are often considered the most important service in the centers for members' engagement.[3] Many types of group exercise classes exist, but generally these include classes based on aerobics, cycling (spinning), boxing or martial arts, high intensity training, step yoga, regular yoga and hot (Bikram) yoga, pilates, muscle training, stretching, and self-defense classes such as Krav Maga and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Health clubs with swimming pools often offer aqua aerobics classes. The instructors often must gain certification in order to teach these classes and ensure participant safety.</p>
