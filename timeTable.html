<h2>Ideal 7-Day Gym Diet</h2>
<img src=" ">
<p class="para">
While calories and macronutrients are important, the ideal gym diet will be one that positively influences health. This is a diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals where all three macronutrients are consumed and nutrient-sparse foods are restricted.
Below you can find a 7-day gym diet guide:

  While the above guide will prove to be useful, be aware that when it comes to nutrition, everyone is different. Not only will physical attributes determine your nutritional requirements, the goals that you have set will also influence your diet.<br><br>
For example, two goals that are extremely common are fat loss and muscle growth. To lose fat, calories must be restricted which will cause stored body fat to be broken down. For muscle growth, calorie intake must be increased to build significant muscle size as additional calories are required to accelerate the recovery process.<br><br>
Macro-nutrient demands for both fat loss and muscle growth are similar. Firstly, protein intake should remain high for both. For muscle growth, protein is evidently required for building mass. The role of protein in fat loss is to prevent muscle tissue breakdown as far as possible.
As highlighted, carbohydrates are extremely important in energy and replenishment. As a result, those looking to lose weight and build muscle should get the majority of their calories from carb sources.  
While consuming healthy fats is important, reducing the total amount of fat consumed helps to most effectively restrict calories. This is because, at nine calories per gram, fats contain the greatest number of calories per gram â€“ protein and carbohydrates both contain four calories per gram.
